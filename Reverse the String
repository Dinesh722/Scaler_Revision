You are given a string A of size N.
Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

NOTE:
A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

A = "the sky is blue"
op = "ib is this"
