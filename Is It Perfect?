For each given integer A, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.
A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

A =  4
1,2 => 1+2 = 3 
op = NO

A = 6
1,2,3 => 1+2+3 = 6
op = Yes

int a = sc.nextInt();
int sum = 0;
for(int i=1;i<=a/2;i++){
  if(a%i==0){
    sum += i;
  }
}
if(sum==a){
  return "YES";
}
return "NO";

TC = O(n/2) -> O(n)
SC = O(1)
